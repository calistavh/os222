1. [Open Vim](https://www.openvim.com)<br>
An short interactive tutorial of Vim (or vi).
It teaches you basic commands to navigate around Vim one by one.
It also has Practice Mode, in which you can test the commands you've learned 
with a list of context-aware actions that changes based on what you've typed.
