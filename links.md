# Additional OS Learning Sources

Welcome to my links page! Here I'll post some links that have helped me 
study OS. I'll try to share different links from the reading assignments 
to add some variation.

1. [Linux Journey](https://linuxjourney.com/)<br>
It's the perfect go-to for those starting out in Linux. 
All sorts of topics are in it, from choosing distributions to networking. 
I believe this site will be relevant throughout the entire course, 
so if you're interested be sure to check it regularly!

2. [Open Vim](https://www.openvim.com/)<br>
A short interactive tutorial of Vim (or vi).
It teaches you basic commands to navigate around Vim one by one.
It also has Practice Mode, in which you can test the commands you've learned 
with a list of context-aware actions that changes based on what you've typed.

3. [Regex Learn](https://regexlearn.com/)<br>
Another interactive tutorial, this time for regular expressions or regex.
Like Open Vim, it features a clean interface so you won't get distracted as you
learn. It also has Cheatsheet for the patterns and Playground to test them out.

4. [Explain Shell](https://explainshell.com/)<br>
A website that tells you what a Linux command line does. 
If you ever get confused with the lines in the assignment instructions, just 
paste them here and it will tell you what each command and option does.

5. [Makefile Tutorial](https://makefiletutorial.com/)
This website may help you if you're struggling in understanding Makefiles for C. 
It starts from the very basic structure then expands on variables, rules, and 
many more.
